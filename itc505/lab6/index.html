      Addendum:

      I decided to create a webpage with a Holy Grail Layout using CSS grid. The layout consists of a header, a menu side-bar, a main content area, an advertisement, and a footer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Header:

      I incorporated a simple header that includes a page title and an image. While the image doesn't have a direct thematic connection to the rest of the site, it serves as a visual element at the top of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Menu Side-Bar:

      The menu side-bar is designed to resemble site navigational controls. Although the links are not functional for the purpose of this assignment, they give the appearance of a typical website menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Main Content Area:

      In the main content area, I implemented a JavaScript feature to fulfill the interactive requirement. The JavaScript code is located in a separate file and linked to the HTML via a using a script tag. The functionality involves Users can interact with buttons, text boxes, or other elements to trigger the JavaScript code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advertisement:

      The advertisement section contains an image that, when clicked, directs users to an Amazon page for the featured product. It's important to note that the content of the advertisement is Safe For Work (SFW), maintaining a user-friendly experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Footer:

      This addendum is part of the footer and serves to describe the problem I solved with the JavaScript code. I implemented providing users with. During the development process, I encountered and the solutions to these difficulties were given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this assignment allowed me to practice creating a Holy Grail Layout with CSS grid and apply JavaScript to build an interactive feature on the webpage.
